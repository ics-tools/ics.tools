# Tests

This folder contains the unit tests for the project. All test dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

The tests are designed to be executed from the project root directory using a test runner like `pytest`. For example:

```bash
pytest
```

Make sure to install the required packages beforehand:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
